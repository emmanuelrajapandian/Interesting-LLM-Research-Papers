# Interesting-LLM-Research-Papers
In this repository, I will provide summaries of compelling research papers related to Large Language Models (LLMs) that I encounter. Interested in reading LLM research papers which try to do something out of the extraordinary like self-driving using LLMs, making LLMs understand causality and much more.

Views expressed are solely mine, and while I strive for accuracy, summaries may not capture every detail or nuance present in the original papers.
